# **Item-Based Filtering Project**

This project demonstrates how to implement an item-based filtering recommendation system. The goal is to provide personalized recommendations by identifying similar items based on user preferences.

**Contents**

* num_proj.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing data analysis, model building, and evaluation steps.

**Requirements**

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

* pandas

* numpy

* scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using:

`pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn`

**How to Run**

1- Clone the Repository: Download the project to your local machine.

`git clone https://github.com/nidanurefe/Item-Based-Filtering.git`

2- Navigate to the Project Directory:

`cd Item-Based-Filtering`

3- Launch Jupyter Notebook:

`jupyter notebook num_proj.ipynb`

**Dataset**

This project utilizes the MovieLens dataset, which contains user ratings for movies. The dataset is commonly used for building and evaluating recommendation systems.

**Features**

* Data preprocessing and analysis

* Similarity computation between items

* Item-based recommendation generation

* Model evaluation and performance metrics
